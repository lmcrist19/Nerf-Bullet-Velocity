# Nerf Bullet Velocity Project

## Description

This Arduino project measures the velocity of a Nerf bullet by calculating the time it takes for the bullet to hit a target after a button press. It uses an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement. This project can be used for various educational and experimental purposes to understand projectile motion and velocity calculations.

## Components

- Arduino board
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Push button
- Various resistors and wires

## Installation

1. Connect the hardware components.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the provided Arduino sketch (`NerfBulletVelocity.ino`) to your Arduino board.

## Usage

1. After uploading the code to the Arduino board, follow these steps:
   - Press the trigger to start the measurement.
   - The system will calculate the velocity of the Nerf bullet based on the time it takes to hit the target.
   - The results, including distance, time, and speed, will be displayed on the serial monitor.

2. Adjust the project setup and components as needed to suit your specific requirements.
